# FIU_dissertation_LaTeX

This LaTeX template for the Florida International University (FIU) biology PhD dissertation and MSc thesis adheres to all University graduate school (UGS) rules and guidelines. I have altered files from the FIU Computer Science department, who altered files from Cornell's dissertation template. See the "instructions_REDME.txt" for additional information.
