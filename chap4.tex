\chapter{SPATIAL VARIATION IN ORGANIC MATTER RECALCITRANCE AND $\delta$\textsuperscript{13}C OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC CARBON IN SEAGRASS SEDIMENTS AS INDICATORS OF CARBON CYCLING AND EXCHANGE PROCESSES}		\label{another chapter}

\section{Abstract}

The soils underlying seagrass ecosystems have been identified as globally important stocks of organic carbon (C\textsubscript{org}) that, if compromised, could significantly exacerbate global greenhouse gas emissions. However, because of variability in chemical composition, the total soil C\textsubscript{org} stock beneath seagrasses is likely to be different than the C\textsubscript{org} vulnerable to remineralization and CO\textsubscript{2} efflux, with the amount at risk likely varying between environmental and ecological conditions. Here we measured 93 seagrass-inhabited sites across the South Florida seascape to characterize the recalcitrance and $\delta$\textsuperscript{13}C values of surface sediments to understand the variability in vulnerable C\textsubscript{org} and its likely fate after remineralization. We used a stepwise thermo-oxidation process to calculate the relative recalcitrance of soil C\textsubscript{org} stocks, finding that soils with finer sediments and higher overall C\textsubscript{org} content contain relatively higher proportions of labile material. We also observed $\delta$\textsuperscript{13}C values of carbonates were related to $\delta$\textsuperscript{13}C values of seagrasses and soil C\textsubscript{org} content, suggesting that C\textsubscript{inorg} processes are tied to organic metabolism. Such findings indicate there are differences in the vulnerability of soil C\textsubscript{org} to oxidation and buffering by carbonate processes influence the links between C\textsubscript{org} stores and the ocean and atmosphere CO\textsubscript{2} reservoirs.
